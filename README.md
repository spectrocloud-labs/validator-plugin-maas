# validator-plugin-maas
The MaaS [validator](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator) plugin ensures that your MaaS configuration matches a user-configurable expected state.

## Description

The MaaS validator plugin reconciles `MaasValidator` custom resources to perform the following validations against your MaaS Instance:

1. Validate MaaS authentication
2. Validate that DNS resolution works (internal and extrnal)
3. Validate that specific OS images exist
4. Validate desired capacity (X machine in each AZ)
5. Validate desired minimum CPU\RAM\Root Disk size resources per machine.

Each `MaasValidator` CR is (re)-processed every two minutes to continuously ensure that your MaaS instance matches the expected state.

See the [samples](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator-plugin-maas/tree/main/config/samples) directory for example `MaasValidator` configurations.

## Installation
The MaaS validator plugin is meant to be [installed by validator](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator/tree/gh_pages#installation) (via a ValidatorConfig), but it can also be installed directly as follows:

```bash
helm repo add validator-plugin-maas https://spectrocloud-labs.github.io/validator-plugin-maas
helm repo update
helm install validator-plugin-maas validator-plugin-maas/validator-plugin-maas -n validator-plugin-maas --create-namespace
```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [kind](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/validator-plugin-maas:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/validator-plugin-maas:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome! Feel free to reach out on the [Spectro Cloud community Slack](https://spectrocloudcommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-g8gfzrhf-cKavsGD_myOh30K24pImLA#/shared-invite/email).

Make sure `pre-commit` is [installed](https://pre-commit.com#install).

Install the `pre-commit` scripts:

```console
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
